2. What are the stages a computer program undergoes, from initial creation to
deployment and execution?

1) Edit time
2) Compile time
3) Link time
4) Distribution time
5) Installation time
6) Load time
7) Run time

3. Explain the purposes of the three steps “lexical analysis”, “parsing process” and
“code generation” in the compilation process.

Sol:
1. lexical analysis:
    * recognizing which strings of symbols from the source program represent a single entity called token
    * identifying whether they are numeric values, words, arithmetic operators, and so on.
2. parsing process:
    * group tokens into statements based on a set of rules, collectively called a grammar
3. code generation:
    * constructing the machine-language instructions to implement the statements recognized by the parser and represented as syntax trees
